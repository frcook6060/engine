# Engine

This is a simple game engine that I'm working of... I'll be developing
a windows engine using DX11 and Windows as a target... I might even add
in OpenGL45 and Vulkan. The goal is to develop an engine not a game with
this system. This will include the engine and tools that will need to 
develop a game with it. It will be a first person 3D engine. I'll list
the features here later but for now lets get started...
